          <div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xja-NdAn840?showinfo=0&modestbranding=1?autoplay=1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
          
        <p>He is part musician, part property owner, part school board employee, and part bingo host.  He is a father, husband, brother, and son.  He is Chris Howdyshell, vocalist and guitarist of the band Dr. How and the Reasons to Live.</p>
          
        <p>Howdyshell supports his passion for music by performing alongside his brother and friends in their band.  However, like the majority of other musicians, he supports his wife and children financially by pursuing a variety of other professions.</p>
          
        <p>According to a survey conducted via the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013, musicians are the highest artistic occupation which comes as second form of employment.  Having more than one job as a musical artist is not only a commonality, but frequently, a necessity.  There are even blog posts such as CarrersInMusic.com which provide lists titled "The Best Day Jobs for Musicians."</p>  
          
        <p>For Howdyshell, growing up means adapting to a plethora of professions.</p>  
          
        <p>“Stability,” he said.  “It’s just all about growing up.”</p>  
          
        <p>His journey began with a job at Little Grill Collective, a restaurant in Harrisonburg, Virgina, which he then purchased with a group of colleagues.</p>
          
        <p>After ten years managing Little Grill, he became the property manager of Agora Market, a downtown Harrisonburg marketplace for small businesses, and Ruby’s Arcade, the nextdoor arcade bar.</p>
          
        <p>On Tuesday nights in Ruby’s Arcade, you can catch Howdyshell and his brother taking a break from music and running a different type of show: Bingo Night.  With great enthusiasm and a beer in hand, the two call out letters, numbers, and offer prizes to lucky card holders.</p>
          
        <p>Finishing off his roster of jobs, Howdyshell also works within the Augusta County Public School System.  Obtaining this job was prompted by his daughter’s dentist appointment and the discovery of eight cavities in her mouth.  When he saw the bill reaching almost 2,000 dollars, he knew he needed to get a job that included health and dental insurance.  So, he joined the school system.</p>
          
        <p>“Hallelujah,” he rejoiced.  “[With insurance from the school system] it only cost me a fraction.”</p>
          
        <p>Howdyshell says he feels fortunate to live in a prime location for live music between the venue options in Harrisonburg, Staunton, and Charlottesville.</p>
          
        <p>Playing a paid gig is exciting, he shares, until you realize you have to share the money with the rest of the band.</p>
          
        <p>“I had a gig at JMU… gave me a grand!  It was awesome!  You know, you're like, ‘Wow, here's 1,000 bucks.’  At the end of the year, I got a phone call from the IRS being like, ‘Hey, you gotta pay taxes on that cause you gave us your social security number...’  I had to prove to them that I was in a band and that the money got spread out amongst five people and it wasn't all mine. So, even when you get these paid gigs if you're not, like, prepared for it, you have to deal with the consequences…”</p>
          
        <p>Howdyshell says the key to overcoming this is, “Don’t do it for the money.”  He plays for community.</p>
          
        <p>This community has become a family… literally.  Not only does he play alongside his brother, but he also met his wife, a violinist, through music.  Now, they teach their son and daughter the art. </p>
          
        <p>“As long as there’s a reason, keep going.”</p>
