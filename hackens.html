        <p>About 15 years ago, a couple of friends from the valley decided to form their own band … little did they know they’d become famous in a small town … and far beyond. Just a couple of friends who enjoyed hunting out in the western part of Virginia are now opening up for some of the biggest names in country music.</p>
          
        <p>The Hackens Boys are a five-member band that resides in Rockingham County, Virginia. Although many members of the original band have come and gone and have swapped out with new members over the years, keeping the band going is important to these small-town musicians. The band has come a long way since its start and one could say they are in the thick of their biggest rise to stardom, right now. </p>
          
        <p>Recently, The Hackens Boys have opened up for some of country music’s biggest names such as Morgan Wallen, Dylan Scott and Seaforth. However, just being the opener doesn’t always pay the bills at home. With many of the band’s members married with children — they all work other jobs outside of their music career.</p>  
          
        <p>“I’m a chicken farmer and I’m poor as shit,” the lead singer Spencer Wenger said. “But I plan my farm job around my music because music is what I want to do.”</p>  
          
        <p>Other band members work as contractors, sheet metal specialists, construction workers and for the Rockingham County government. However, Wenger seemingly works the most unique job at the farm. </p>  
          
        <p>“I get there around seven every day,” Wenger said. “You have to walk through our six chicken houses … I pick up the dead ones because there’s like 38,000 in a house and make sure nothing’s broken and all the ventilation and fans are working, and then I feed the chickens.”</p>
          
        <p>Although everyday life may not be so glamorous for The Hackens Boys, the life they live on the road is much more extravagant. From drinking with the boys every day to the slew of people you get to meet, life as a musician has its perks.</p>
          
        <p>“I’m the youngest one in the group by 10 years,” Wenger said. “But these are my best friends and we just enjoy playing together and hanging out.”</p>
          
        <p>The music industry is a tough place to make it big. Those who do, are passionate beyond measure of their work, and although The Hackens Boys aren’t necessarily looking to “make it big,” they still put their music first.</p>
          
        <p>“I don’t know if we’ll ‘make it big’,” Wenger said. “How do you define someone who makes it big you know? For all I know we’ve already made it big, but we’re just focused on playing shows and building a fan base.”</p>
          
        <p>The more people they meet and the more bands they open up for, the closer The Hackens Boys get to becoming a household name. Creating their own music and lyrics along with their traditional country sound has given them a loyal fan base. </p>
          
        <p>“We’ve been playing a lot at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville,” Wenger said. “Which is where all the ‘next big things’ play, so that’s cool for us.”</p>
          
        <p>With a new album, King of the Wild, just released, The Hackens Boys are well on their way to becoming an established country music band. However, even if they never get to be the main act they will always continue with the band, as they have become one of the most accomplished bands to come out of the Rockingham County/ northwestern Virginia.</p>
          
        <p>“It’s not something that’s gonna come easy,” Wenger said. “You’ve got to put in the hours and the time to practice, especially if you want to do original music. You've got to work on your writing and just dive into it as hard as you can.”</p>
