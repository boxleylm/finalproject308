        <p>You can hear Neon-soul and R&amp;b coming from Brian’s keyboard most days of the week. A senior at James Madison University, he is a vocal student who studies music industry. When he isn’t in class, he devotes most of his time to writing, making, and performing music, saying he probably spends half his week making music. He was raised by his grandparents and mother in Warrenton, VA but currently resides in Culpeper, VA. In the past, he has performed at many open-mic events, shows and has released a lot of original songs. For Sauerwald, music has no fault. He began playing guitar at age 11 and has been singing forever. He recalls singing in the car as a kid and his 7th grade talent show was a big moment for Sauerwald because it was the first moment he realized people liked to hear him sing. He called it a “no-brainer” when he decided to pursue music.</p>
          
        <p>As a student at JMU, his friends and teachers really inspire him and are great resources to learn from. “A guitar is just a guitar, or my voice is just my voice, but they teach me how to use it or how to live through it.” Other students at JMU are also friendly competition. He remembers thinking he was a “pretty good” musician and then came to JMU and was amazed at all the other music students. But these other talented artists make him want to push himself harder and be a better singer and songwriter. He even jokes that if he gets an inspiration for a new piece of music, he will stop what he’s doing, even if it’s homework, to follow the thought.</p>
          
        <p>While in college, Sauerwald has a part time job to have a source of income. When asked what his biggest hardship was in music, he instantly said making money. Sadly, it is not a career that has cash easily flowing, but that doesn’t stop Sauerwald. He tries to keep his jobs within the music field and currently does recording in the sound booth of the Forbes Performing Arts Center at JMU. This job teaches him more about recording and he gets to work alongside Tom Carr who he looks up to and called the “guru of sound” and a “genius.”</p>  
          
        <p>One of his biggest inspirations is John Mayer. He has childhood memories of him listening to his albums at the bus stop and said, “he is very honest with his music and his words.” Sauerwald even has a tattoo of the initials “J.C.M” on his left bicep dedicated to Mayer.</p>  
          
        <p>Outside of music he enjoys his classes and video games. He even originally wanted to be a video game designer, but music is his life’s passion. He tries to balance his life between music and school and friends, but he acknowledges it’s easier said than done. In the future he hopes to continue pursuing his music career and has potential plans to move to Nashville which he calls the “songwriting Mecca.” He noted that his goal isn’t really to be a top tier musician anymore like the big artists because there are still amazing artists in the “B and C” tiers and it may take less toll on his mental health. He’d rather have a loyal fanbase at the lower level.</p>  
          
        <p>His advice to those who wish to pursue a career in music is, “don’t stop doing it because it is what we loved in the first place.” He admits it’s really hard and may lead to being broke, but a break will find you eventually. For Sauerwald, it’s hard for him to find something he doesn’t like about music. “Even when it’s bad, it’s still like I’m doing what I love to do.” </p>
