          <h3><i>“My general purpose in life is to help people.”</i></h3>
          
        <p>Gihad Salih, 22, is the first-born American in a long linage of a Sudanese family. However, comparing his childhood Northern Virginia home to a ‘mini Sudan’, one could say his ancestors’ country still consumes a huge chunk of his life. With that, Salih is aware of the injustice and unrest happening over 6,000 miles away with Dictator Omar al-Bashi. </p>
          
        <p>Salih knew he had an opportunity to connect the two cultures and create change with one common medium: music.</p>  
          
        <p>“The basic amenities that we have here, that they [Sudanese people] don’t have there and realizing that there’s a disparity between life here and life there, at a young age,” Salih said. “That helped me form that purpose of I want to help people that don’t have as much as I have.”</p>  
          
        <p>Salih started writing when he was a freshman in high school just a decade ago. His rhymes started as journal entries, short poems and a space for him to self-reflect. He almost never shared the words he was curating.</p>  
          
        <p>Over the years, he put the phrases to beats but would only share his music to a select number of close friends.</p>
          
        <p>“The type of feedback that I was getting is what made me take the next step with music,” He remembers. “It wasn’t just ‘Oh, this is good.’ It was ‘Yo, I listen to this, and I relate to this. This is music that inspires me.’”</p>
          
        <p>Transiting into his secondary education at James Madison University, he started writing more and more. He released his first SoundCloud song his sophomore year.</p>
          
        <p> Since then, G-Salih (rap name), has released singles such as “OTW,” “Bloom,” “Prominence” and “4AM Flows” as well as a few freestyles and features. His first EP is set to drop on December 16. A short album of six songs he describes to be a ‘snapshot of his life right now.’</p>
          
        <p>After walking across the stage in front of Wilson Hall this past May, draped in purple, he completed hundreds of full-time job applications with music still in the back of his mind. </p>
          
        <p>“My dad always says, ‘stay open minded. Don’t ever close an opportunity or close a gate.’”</p>
          
        <p>He applied to jobs that if he weren’t going to pursue music, they would be his dream job. Such as a social consultant at a company called Global Impact in Alexandra, Virginia.</p>
          
        <p>He got in.</p>
          
        <p>“No matter what the option was, I can create an optimal outcome for each one,” He thinks back on deciding between the pros and cons on taking a corporate job or following music. “My gut was telling me to not take anything and focus on music and how much you can build it, focus on your passions at this time of your life and then see where it takes you.”</p>
          
        <p>This was his motto until him and a few friends were talking down the streets in Georgetown, D.C. There were homeless people at each corner and one man sitting on a cardboard box with raggedy and ripped clothes approached them.</p>
          
        <p>“We didn’t have any change, we usually carried cards,” Salih remembers.</p>
          
        <p>The man didn’t want money. He wanted a conversation.</p>
          
        <p>He stressed that he goes through a lot of hardships, from going from soup kitchen to soup kitchen or dealing with the poorly ran homeless shelters. The biggest challenge he faces although, is being looked at as less than a human being.</p>
          
        <p>That was it.</p>
          
        <p>Going back to his roots of always wanting to help people, Salih and his friends decided to combine a non-profit and a clothing brand. They would call it Human International.</p>
          
        <p>“On every tee it says Human. The first thing you see when you see someone is human on their tee and that’s the first label,” he said. “Before it’s their race, their culture before it’s their religion, before they can even say a word to you - it’s human.”</p>
          
        <p>The clothing brand gives some proceeds to different charities from each order.</p>
          
        <p>The clothing company, features and touring is what keep G-Salih on his feet and secure finically.</p>
          
        <p>But it’s his passion that keeps his in motion each day.</p>
          
        <p>“I’m on a mission in terms of I know how hard it is to crack into the music industry and how bad I want it,” he said. “So, I do balance my social and my personal life and my music and my business but for me, for now, the work that I’m doing is a little bit more important because I’m trying so desperately to make it. So, it’s more like work now, have fun later.”</p>
